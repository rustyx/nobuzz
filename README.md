## NoBuzz
NoBuzz is a free computer buzzing/mosquito noise removal utility.

The high pitch, tinny mosquito-like noise is often caused by applications like Chrome and Flash which increase system timer resolution to 1ms,
which causes some aging PC systems (especially laptops) to buzz at 1KHz.

### How does it work?

NoBuzz attempts to prevent calls to `timeBeginPeriod(uPeriod)` with uPeriod value <16. This is often sufficient to stop the mosquito noise.

Note: NoBuzz is _not a cure_ for the buzzing issue, it is merely a workaround. Side effects include:
* Animations might be less smooth
* Some applications might not function properly (please open a ticket if you find one)
* Not recommended for game systems

Note also that there are other ways to increase system timer resolution, and some applications (e.g. virtualization software) will still be able to do that.

### Installation

Download the latest [setup file](https://github.com/rustyx/nobuzz/releases/download/v0.5/nobuzz_setup.exe), install, reboot (or log off/on), enjoy!

Note: if the mosquito noise still remains, `powercfg -energy` might be able to provide an answer on which app increased the timer resolution.

### How can I help?

Use it, star it, share it and let me know if it worked for you!
